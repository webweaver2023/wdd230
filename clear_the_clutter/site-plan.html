        <b>The Process</b>
          <br><br><b>Initial Consultaion-</b>We start with every client by assessing organizational needs. Potential clients will upload photos of their space, and inspiration for their project.  In the initial consult, we discuss the space, budget, and what you're looking for in a partner to achieve organizational goals. 
          <br><br><b>Proposal-</b>Once we have a good idea of your needs and wishes, we'll send you a proposal for the space. The proposal will detail the hours and supplies needed to complete your project to your satisfaction.
          Once a contract is agreed upon, a date is booked for your in-home organization project.
          <br><br><b>Organizing-</b>On the date scheduled, our team will arrive with everything in hand to de-clutter, sort, label and place where you will be able to sustain your organization needs moving forward. 
          <br><br><b>Enjoy Your Space-</b>We remove all trash and donate any items you no longer need; leaving you with a space that you can enjoy for years to come.
