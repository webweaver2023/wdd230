          <br><b>Initial Consultaion-</b>We start with every client by assessing organizational needs. Potential clients will upload photos of their space, and inspiration for their project.

          Once a contract is agreed upon, a date is booked for your in-home organization project.
          <br><br><b>Organizing-</b>On the date scheduled, our team will arrive with everything in hand to de-clutter, sort, label and place where you will be able to sustain your organization needs moving forward. 
          <br><br><b>Enjoy Your Space-</b>We remove all trash and donate any items you no longer need; leaving you with a space that you can enjoy for years to come.
